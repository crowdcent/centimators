# Centimators: essential data transformers and model estimators for ML and data science competitions

Centimators is an open-source python library built on scikit-learn, keras, and narwhals: designed for building and sharing dataframe-agnostic (pandas/polars), multi-framework (jax/tf/pytorch), sklearn-style (fit/transform/predict) transformers, meta-estimators, and machine learning models for data science competitions like Numerai, Kaggle, and the CrowdCent Challenge. 

Centimators makes heavy use of advanced scikit-learn concepts such as metadata routing. Familiarity with these concepts is recommended for optimal use of the library. You can learn more about metadata routing in the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/metadata_routing.html).

## Installation

Recommended (using uv):
```bash
uv add centimators
```

Or, using pip:
```bash
pip install centimators
```
